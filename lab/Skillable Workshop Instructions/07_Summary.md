# Summary 

Well done! You made it to the end of the workshop successfully, generating text, images, and exploring reasoning capabilities of generative AI, by interacting through multimodal interfaces.

## Some key points to remember
- Generative AI models can generate human-like text, images, and code
- Generative AI models are stateless: they do not learn, and are constrained by their training data which is frozen at a fixed point in time
- Azure AI Foundry Models is a managed service that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language generative AI models, including models from the OpenAI family with the security and enterprise promise of Azure.
- Azure AI Foundry is Azure's unified AI platform representing the Azure AI portal and unified SDK experiences in addition to pre-built app templates and access to 3P ISV tools and services.
- Prompt engineering and RAG are techniques for "grounding" generative AI models, and can be used to influence the style of a model's output, provide factual information, and constrain unintended behavior.
- Azure AI Agent Service is a feature that makes it easier for developers to create applications with sophisticated copilot-like experiences that can sift through data, suggest solutions, and automate tasks by integrating tools.
