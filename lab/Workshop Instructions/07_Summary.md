# Summary
Well done! You made it to the end of the workshop successfully, generating text, images, and exploring reasoning capabilities of generative AI, by interacting through multimodal interfaces.

## Clean up Resources

Once you're finished with the tutorial, you might want to delete all resources you created. You can delete the resource individually, or you can delete the entire resource Group.

1. Browse to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. From the homepage, navigate to **Resource groups** and select the resource group we create: **interact-with-llms**.

## Some key points to remember
- Generative AI models can generate human-like text, images, and code
- Generative AI models are stateless: they do not learn, and are constrained by their training data which is frozen at a fixed point in time
- Azure AI Foundry Models is a managed service that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language generative AI models, including models from the OpenAI family with the security and enterprise promise of Azure.
- Azure AI Foundry is Azure's unified AI platform representing the Azure AI portal and unified SDK experiences in addition to pre-built app templates and access to 3P ISV tools and services.
- Prompt engineering and RAG are techniques for "grounding" generative AI models, and can be used to influence the style of a model's output, provide factual information, and constrain unintended behavior.
- Azure AI Agent Service is a feature that makes it easier for developers to create applications with sophisticated copilot-like experiences that can sift through data, suggest solutions, and automate tasks by integrating tools.
