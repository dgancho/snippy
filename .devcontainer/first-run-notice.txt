# 🚀 Welcome to Snippy Codespace!

## What is Snippy?
Snippy is an intelligent code snippet service that demonstrates Azure Functions with MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools - making your functions accessible to GitHub Copilot and other AI assistants.

## 📋 Features
- Save code snippets with vector embeddings in Cosmos DB
- Perform semantic search across your code library
- Generate documentation and style guides with AI agents
- Experience MCP integration with GitHub Copilot

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Authenticate with Azure:
   ```bash
   azd auth login --use-device-code
   ```

2. Deploy all resources:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

3. Once deployed, use the MCP URL with GitHub Copilot Chat in Agent mode!
